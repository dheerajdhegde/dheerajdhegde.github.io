## Introduction

Welcome to my E-Commerce Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my work and accomplishments in the field of E-Commerce management and algorithmic problem-solving. Throughout this portfolio, you'll find details of my projects, experiences, and learning journey during the Algorithmic Problem Solving course at KLE Technological University.




## Objectives

- User search and Profile management by using efficient Data structures and Algortihm.
- Building Connections with other users and sharing of the recent trends ad activities.
- Having a recommendation system basis on the user activity and also relating to the activity of profile user follows.



## Business Cases

Throughout the course, various challenges were encountered, ranging from algorithmic complexities to practical implementation hurdles. Each challenge presented an opportunity for learning and growth, contributing to the overall development.

### 1.Efficient Search 
The users should be able to search the profiles and content across the globe, so we can use the algorithms

**Full-Text Search:** Searches within documentation and repositories.<br>
**Algorithm:** Inverted Index <br>
**Time Complexity:** <br>
Indexing: O(n log n) where n is the number of documents.<br>
Querying: O(k + log n) where k is the number of query terms.<br>

**Trie for Prefix Search:** Supports efficient prefix-based search and autocomplete.<br>
**Algorithm:** Trie (Prefix Tree) <br>
**Time Complexity:** <br>
Insertion: O(m) where m is the length of the key.<br>
Search: O(m) where m is the length of the key.

### 2. Recommendation System
The users should recieve recommendations on basis of there mutual and common links they have creted where new links and content both can be recomended.
**Collaborative filtering:** This technique analyzes user behavior and interactions to suggest connections, jobs, or content similar to what others with similar profiles have engaged with.  Imagine it as finding users who walk a similar professional path and recommending things that were valuable to them.
- **Time Complexity:** O(U*I^2) where U and I represent the total number of Users and Items.
- **Space Complexity:** O(U*I) for the 2D matrix
